# Models

This directory is intended for 3D models or design files used in the construction of the vehicle.  
Examples: STL files for 3D printing, DXF files for laser cutting, or STEP files for CAD assembly.

Currently, no dedicated model files are provided.  
All structural elements of the vehicle were built manually using off-the-shelf components and custom mounts.
